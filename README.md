Hello, this is me building my first site. I am using LLM models to optimize my work. It is not ideal, not a reference; I am just trying something new.

What I am researching:

I am thinking about creating something that people could use, starting from just my portfolio.

27.12.2025 I decided that me giving lessons should be shown on the site too. That's why I added the "I help with math and physics" section.

I want to put it on GitHub and make it live. It is human made.
